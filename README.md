# AgeAndHeritageGuesserAPIs
This is a basic project demonstrating full-stack capabilities using standard web frameworks and API handling

Stack used: Vue.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Combined 4 APIs, used Heritage.io, Ageify.io, a country flag API, and the UN appreviation API

The first name of the user is put in the application then it sends the name to Heritage.io and Ageify.io seperately. It then takes the Heritage.io prediction and sends it to the flag and appreciation APIs and displays the result
